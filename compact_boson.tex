{\bf\color{red}Remember to mention in the main text, winding sectors have no contribution}

{\bf\color{red} say motivation: Winding sectors cannot be determined from above. Extension of constraint to zero mode. Conformal invariance is intact. Say linear combination and constraints }

{\bf\color{red} say objective: Has only $\ln\beta$ contribution}
