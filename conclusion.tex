In this paper, we analyzed a class of boson conformal interfaces by computing the Loschmidt echo and the bipartite fidelity. 

We began by classifying the boundary states by two types of $S$ matrices $S_1(\theta)$ and $S_2(\theta)$, where the parameter $\theta$ -- the scattering angle -- is determined by the transmission coefficient of the interface. The conventional `DD', `NN' boundary conditions belong to special choice of $\theta$ in $S_1$ and  `DN' and P belongs to $S_2$. Generic value of $\theta$ then interpolates between those conventional boundary conditions. A harmonic chain model allows us to realize part of these partially-transmitive boundary conditions in a concrete lattice setting. 

The dynamical behavior of the Loschmidt echo reflects the change of the conformal interface, which we denote as
\begin{equation}
S_i( \theta_1 ) \rightarrow S_j( \theta_2 )  \quad i, j = 1, 2. 
\end{equation}
Its power law decay exponent is related to the scaling dimension of the bcc operator that mediates these interfaces. Analytic computation shows that the exponent is always $\frac{1}{4}$ when the change of boundary condition is made between different types of $S$ matrices ($i \ne j$), regardless of the choice of $\theta$. On the other hand, the exponent depends on the difference of angles $\theta_1 - \theta_2$ as a quadratic relation when the change is made between the same types of $S$ matrices ($i = j$).

These two features were tested in three typical processes in the numerical calculation of the harmonic chains. After using suitable regulators for the zero-mode problem, the numerical results agreed with the analytic calculation within error. Although tangential to the non-equilibrium dynamics, the fidelity calculation was used as a diagnostic tool and shows better agreement of the exponent, providing more confidence about our analytic results. 

We proposed that the Loschmidt echo exponent in principle should be detectable in an X-ray edge singulrity type experiment on quantum wires systems.
