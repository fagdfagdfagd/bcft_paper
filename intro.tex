In (one-dimensional) quantum critical systems, the presence of the physical boundary and isolated impurity weakly break the conformal symmetry of the system. Simply put, the scattering on the interface relates the otherwise independent modes and therefore demonstrates novel boundary critical phenomena\cite{cardy_boundary_2004}. Operators close to the boundary are interpreted as boundary condition changing (bcc) operators\cite{oshikawa_boundary_1997,affleck_boundary_1997} in the boundary conformal field theory (CFT). Their correlation functions can exhibit different critical exponents from the bulk counterparts\cite{cardy_conformal_1984}. One example is the ``Anderson orthogonality catastrophe", where the core hole creates a potential that acts as an impurity to the conduction band. The X-ray absorption rate will then have a power singularity of boundary exponent\cite{affleck_boundary_1997} at the resonance frequency. There are numerous impurity problems of this kind that have been studied in the last few decades, such as the magnetic impurity in spin chain\cite{eggert_magnetic_1992}, boundary and impurity effects in Luttinger liquid\cite{fabrizio_interacting_1995}, entanglement of the defects\cite{peschel_entanglement_2005, igloi_entanglement_2009,calabrese_entanglement_2012} \etc

% non-equilibrium dynamics, particle mediate the two parts, Cardy cut-and-join protocol, Vassur majarana
Recently, more attention has been paid to the non-equilibrium dynamics of the quantum impurity. \cite{hegde_quench_2015,francica_local_2016,lupo_transient_2016,lee_spatiotemporal_2016,chung_memory_2016,sacramento_edge_2016,vasseur_expansion_2015,mazza_overlap_2016}The ``cut-and-join" quench protocol is a popular framework for studying the spreading of the influence from the localized impurity (or boundary) across the system. As shown in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:cut-and-join}, the system consists of two critical chains A and B, which were prepared in the ground states. They will be joined at $t = 0$ and evolve. Various quantities can be used to detect the information in the quench process. For instance, Ref.~\onlinecite{calabrese_entanglement_2007, calabrese_quantum_2016} find a logarithmic increase of entanglement entropy in subsystem $A$, when both $A$ and $B$ are identical critical systems. The authors ascribe such increase to the proliferation and propagation of quasi-particle excitations emitted at the joint. Ref.~\onlinecite{vasseur_universal_2014} takes A to be a normal lead and B to be a topological superconductor in the topological phase. In this model, the Majorana zero mode acts as a bcc and its conformal dimension appears in the exponent of the power law decay for the Loschmidt echo.

% All of these are the same CFTs. we consider different CFTs, the mediating particle or primary field will be different, from the S matrix point of view.
In the path integral language, the ``cut-and-join" protocol corresponds to a spacetime diagram as shown in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:cut-and-join}. The separating ground states prepared before $t = 0$ are joined to form a new type of interface between them. Before the quench, the slit represents boundaries that are completely reflective to the injecting particles. The joining turns on the transmission from one side to the other. In the entanglement entropy and Loschmidt echo examples cited above\cite{calabrese_entanglement_2007, calabrese_quantum_2016, vasseur_universal_2014}, the two sides of the CFTs are the same (chiral fermion CFT in the case of Ref.~\onlinecite{vasseur_universal_2014}) and the boundary becomes totally transparent after the joining. 

In this paper, we generalize these ideas and consider connecting two different CFTs in the ``cut-and-join" protocol. The interface produced will interpolate between the total reflective and complete transparent ones. As discussed in Ref.~\onlinecite{bachas_permeable_2002}, such interface can be realized as a domain wall between two free compact boson theories with different compactification radii. Entanglement properties for non-compact free boson/free fermion lattices have been numerically and analytically studied\cite{peschel_exact_2012,sakai_entanglement_2008}. In these models, there is a parameter $\lambda$ that is directly related to the transmission coefficient. In the case of compact boson $\lambda$ is controlled by the ratio of the compactification radii, whereas it is controlled by the ratio of masses in the case of free lattice boson. We expect it to be tunable in a realistic experimental setting.

% fidelity and Loschmidt echo are quantities that extract boundary critical exponents, may reveal the nature of the mediating particle 
Fidelity and Loschmidt echo are the two quantities we compute to extract information from the quench process. Fidelity is the (square of) the overlap of the ground state wavefunctions of the Hamiltonians before and after the quench. There is no dynamic information in fidelity; nevertheless its finite size effect also reveals the boundary critical exponent that may be diagnostic for the Loschmidt echo computation. The Loschmidt echo is (square of) the overlap of the wavefunctions before the quench and the wavefunction evolved for some time $t$. The Loschmidt echo decays with a power law for the lack of length scale in the $t \rightarrow \infty$ limit. Its exponent has been calculated for various geometries and combinations of normal boundary conditions of the same CFTs in \onlinecite{stephan_logarithmic_2013,stephan_local_2011}. In this paper we extend the analysis to the aforementioned parametric interface of (possibly) different CFTs. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec:bosonic_conformal_interface}, we introduce the general formalism for permeable conformal interface and its lattice realization. In Sec.~\ref{sec:analytic_numerics}, we analytically evaluate the free energy associated with fidelity and Loschmidt echo, and present the numerical results for comparison. We discuss our results and related experimental works in Sec.~\ref{sec:disc}. Finally we conclude in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}. 

This paper includes several appendices for technical details. In App.~\ref{app:F_correction}, we point out two corrections to the free energy, which are complementary to the argument made in the main text. We derive the scale invariant interface for free bosonic lattice in App.~\ref{app:interface_free_boson}. The details of numerical simulation is presented in App.~\ref{app:comp_fid_echo}. In App.~\ref{app:pf_of_id}, we prove one identity that will be used repeatedly in the analytical evaluation. We calculate the free energy of one particular setup as an example in App.~\ref{app:gnd_dn_lambda}. The result is generalized to arbitrary boundary conditions in App.~\ref{app:lambda_12}. Up until this point, we work exclusively with the oscillator modes of the free bosons. In App.~\ref{app:compact_diff_boson}, it is shown that the winding modes of compactified bosons will \emph{not} contribute to the free energy at the leading order. Therefore the results remain valid in the physical situation of connecting two compactified bosons of different radii.
