1. relating the bcc scaling with Casimir energy(ground state energy difference) through a conformal mapping.
2. X-ray edge singularity: when X-ray hit the metal and kick out a core electron, the resulting hole will change the potential for the conduction electron. In the IR, the effective is captured by a phase shift in the Dirac electron and hence a bcc effect.
It seems that the phase shift conformal interface always gives quadratic scaling dimensions.
3. Kondo problem with spin. The scaling dimension is given by the Kac-Moody algebra. I don't quite understand this calculation. },

The impurity corresponds to the substitution of a magnetic ion by a different ion with the same or different spin, or else to the coupling of a magnetic impurity to a single spin on the chain. Depending on which kind of impurity is present, the low-energy behavior corresponds either to a ‘‘healing’’ of the defect or else to a severing of the chain at the impurity location. In both cases there is a coupling-dependent length scale over which magnetic screening takes place. Analogies with the Kondo effect are elucidated.},

We develop tools to study such domain walls, extending and clarifying the concept of `folding' discussed in the condensed-matter literature. We analyze the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry, and discuss the holographic duals in AdS3 when they exist. One of the interesting observables is the Casimir energy between a wall and an anti-wall. When these separate free scalar field theories with different target-space radii, the Casimir energy is given by the dilogarithm function of the reflection probability. The walls with holographic duals in AdS3 separate two sigma models, whose target spaces are moduli spaces of Yang-Mills instantons on T4 or K3. In the supergravity limit, the Casimir energy is computable as classical energy of a brane that connects the walls through AdS3. We compare this result with expectations from the sigma-model point of view.},

Possible boundary states on the \$Z\_2\$ orbifold theory are explored, and a special case is applied to the Ising defect problem. We find the complete spectrum of boundary operators, exact two-point correlation functions and the universal term in the free energy of the defect line for arbitrary strength of the defect. We also find a new universality class of defect lines. It is conjectured that we have found all the possible universality classes of defect lines in the Ising model.

Two kinds of boundary conditions are examined, along open boundaries of the system, or along closed curves or ``seams''. Solving consistency conditions known as Cardy equation is shown to amount to the algebraic problem of finding integer valued representations of (one or two copies of) the fusion algebra. Graphs encode these boundary conditions in a natural way, but are also relevant in several aspects of physics ``in the bulk''. Quantum algebras attached to these graphs contain information on structure constants of the operator algebra, on the Boltzmann weights of the corresponding integrable lattice models etc. Thus the study of boundary conditions in Conformal Field Theory offers a new perspective on several old physical problems and offers an explicit realisation of recent mathematical concepts.},

	abstract = {Zeta-function regularization is a powerful method in perturbation theory, and this book is a comprehensive guide for the student of this subject. Everything is explained in detail, in particular the mathematical difficulties and tricky points, and several applications are given to show how the procedure works in practice, for example in the Casimir effect, gravity and string theory, high-temperature phase transition, topological symmetry breaking, and non-commutative spacetime. The formulae, some of which are new, can be directly applied in creating physically meaningful, accurate numerical calculations. The book acts both as a basic introduction and a collection of exercises for those who want to apply this regularization procedure in practice. Thoroughly revised, updated and expanded, this new edition includes novel, explicit formulas on the general quadratic, the Chowla-Selberg series case, an interplay with the Hadamard calculus, and also features a fresh chapter on recent cosmological applications, including the calculation of the vacuum energy fluctuations at large scale in braneworld and other models.},

	abstract = {We study subleading corrections to the corner free energy in classical two-dimensional critical systems, focusing on a generic boundary perturbation by the stress-tensor of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT). In the particular case of an angle 2π, we find that there is an unusual correction of the form L−1logL, where L is a typical length scale in the system. This correction also affects the one-point function of an operator near the corner. The prefactor can be seen as semi-universal, in the sense that it depends on a single non-universal quantity, the extrapolation length. Once this ultraviolet cutoff is known, the term is entirely fixed by the geometry of the system, and the central charge of the CFT. Such a corner appears for example in the bipartite fidelity of a one-dimensional quantum system at criticality, which allows for several numerical checks in free fermion systems. We also present an exact result in the XX and Ising chains that confirms this analysis. Finally, we consider applications to the time evolution of the (logarithmic) Loschmidt echo and the entanglement entropy following a local quantum quench. Due to subtle issues in analytic continuation, we find that the logarithmic term in imaginary time transforms into a time-dependent L−2 correction for the entanglement entropy, and a L−2logL term for the Loschmidt echo.},

	abstract = {We study a particular type of local quench in a generic quantum critical one-dimensional system, using conformal field theory (CFT) techniques, and providing numerical checks of the results in free fermion systems. The system is initially cut into two subsystems A and B which are glued together at time t = 0. We study the entropy of entanglement (EE) between the two parts A and B , using previous results obtained by Calabrese andCardy (2004 J. Stat. Mech. P06002; 2007 J. Stat. Mech. P10004), and further extending them. We also study in detail the (logarithmic) Loschmidt echo (LLE). For finite size systems both quantities turn out to be (almost) periodic in the scaling limit, and exhibit striking light-cone effects. While these two quantities behave similarly immediately after the quench—namely as c /3log t for the EE and c /4log t for the LLE—we observe some discrepancy once the excitations emitted by the quench bounce on the boundary and evolve within the same subsystem A (or B ). The decay of the EE is then non-universal, as noticed by Eisler andPeschel (2007 J. Stat. Mech. P06005). In contrast, we find that the evolution of the LLE is less sensitive than the EE to non-universal details of the model, and is still accurately described by our CFT prediction. To further probe these light-cone effects, we also introduce a variant of the Loschmidt echo specifically constructed to detect the excitations emitted just after the quench.},

The purposeof this bookis to providecorema- rial in the symplectic treatment of quantum mechanics, in both its semi-classical and in its “full-blown” operator-theoretical formulation, with a special emphasis on so-called phase-space techniques. It is also intended to be a work of reference for the reading of more advanced texts in the rapidly expanding areas of sympl- tic geometry and topology, where the prerequisites are too often assumed to be “well-known”bythe reader. Thisbookwillthereforebeusefulforbothpurema- ematicians and mathematical physicists. My dearest wish is that the somewhat novel presentation of some well-established topics (for example the uncertainty principle and Schrod ̈ inger’s equation) will perhaps shed some new light on the fascinating subject of quantization and may open new perspectives for future - terdisciplinary research. I have tried to present a balanced account of topics playing a central role in the “symplectization of quantum mechanics” but of course this book in great part represents my own tastes. Some important topics are lacking (or are only alluded to): for instance Kirillov theory, coadjoint orbits, or spectral theory. We will moreover almost exclusively be working in ?at symplectic space: the slight loss in generality is, from my point of view, compensated by the fact that simple things are not hidden behind complicated “intrinsic” notation.},

	abstract = {We construct a contour function for the entanglement entropies in generic harmonic lattices. In one spatial dimension, numerical analysis are performed by considering harmonic chains with either periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the massless regime and for some configurations where the subsystem is a single interval, the numerical results for the contour function are compared to the inverse of the local weight function which multiplies the energy-momentum tensor in the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian, found through conformal field theory methods, and a good agreement is observed. A numerical analysis of the contour function for the entanglement entropy is performed also in a massless harmonic chain for a subsystem made by two disjoint intervals.},

Williamson theorem is crucial in the construction of the entanglement contour. They define their mode participation function as contributions from site i to the entropy associated with jth Williamson eigenvalue.
It has a clear discussion of the Williamson theorem and the its proof.},
