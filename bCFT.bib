	abstract = {We study conformal field theories in two dimensions separated by domain walls, which preserve at least one Virasoro algebra. We develop tools to study such domain walls, extending and clarifying the concept of `folding' discussed in the condensed-matter literature. We analyze the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry, and discuss the holographic duals in AdS3 when they exist. One of the interesting observables is the Casimir energy between a wall and an anti-wall. When these separate free scalar field theories with different target-space radii, the Casimir energy is given by the dilogarithm function of the reflection probability. The walls with holographic duals in AdS3 separate two sigma models, whose target spaces are moduli spaces of Yang-Mills instantons on T4 or K3. In the supergravity limit, the Casimir energy is computable as classical energy of a brane that connects the walls through AdS3. We compare this result with expectations from the sigma-model point of view.},

Possible boundary states on the \$Z\_2\$ orbifold theory are explored, and a special case is applied to the Ising defect problem. We find the complete spectrum of boundary operators, exact two-point correlation functions and the universal term in the free energy of the defect line for arbitrary strength of the defect. We also find a new universality class of defect lines. It is conjectured that we have found all the possible universality classes of defect lines in the Ising model.

Two kinds of boundary conditions are examined, along open boundaries of the system, or along closed curves or ``seams''. Solving consistency conditions known as Cardy equation is shown to amount to the algebraic problem of finding integer valued representations of (one or two copies of) the fusion algebra. Graphs encode these boundary conditions in a natural way, but are also relevant in several aspects of physics ``in the bulk''. Quantum algebras attached to these graphs contain information on structure constants of the operator algebra, on the Boltzmann weights of the corresponding integrable lattice models etc. Thus the study of boundary conditions in Conformal Field Theory offers a new perspective on several old physical problems and offers an explicit realisation of recent mathematical concepts.},

	abstract = {We show that the free energy at criticality of a finite two-dimensional system of characteristic size L has in general a term which behaves like ln L as L → ∞. The coefficient of this term is universal and is proportional to the conformal anomaly number c. Furthermore, when the metric is non-singular and the boundaries are smooth, this coefficient depends only on the topology and is equal to −16cgX, whereΞ is the Euler characteristic. However, if there are conical singularities in the metric, or corners on the boundary, this is no longer true. For these cases, we give the correct result.},

	abstract = {We study subleading corrections to the corner free energy in classical two-dimensional critical systems, focusing on a generic boundary perturbation by the stress-tensor of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT). In the particular case of an angle 2π, we find that there is an unusual correction of the form L−1logL, where L is a typical length scale in the system. This correction also affects the one-point function of an operator near the corner. The prefactor can be seen as semi-universal, in the sense that it depends on a single non-universal quantity, the extrapolation length. Once this ultraviolet cutoff is known, the term is entirely fixed by the geometry of the system, and the central charge of the CFT. Such a corner appears for example in the bipartite fidelity of a one-dimensional quantum system at criticality, which allows for several numerical checks in free fermion systems. We also present an exact result in the XX and Ising chains that confirms this analysis. Finally, we consider applications to the time evolution of the (logarithmic) Loschmidt echo and the entanglement entropy following a local quantum quench. Due to subtle issues in analytic continuation, we find that the logarithmic term in imaginary time transforms into a time-dependent L−2 correction for the entanglement entropy, and a L−2logL term for the Loschmidt echo.},

We construct the explicit oscillator representation for the free boson and fermionic ghost. The inner product of such states describes a disk amplitude of rectangular shape and possesses modular covariance with a nontrivial conformal weight. We compare the result obtained here with those obtained using two different methods, one employing the path integral formalism and one employing the conformal anomaly. We find that all these methods give consistent results. In our method, we must be careful in our treatment of the singularity of the CFT near the corners. Specifically, we derive the correction to the conformal weight of the primary field inserted at the corner, and it gives the modular weight of the rectangle amplitude. We also carry out explicit computations of the correlation functions.},

One significant difference is that the conserved charges are logarithms of natural numbers, rather than vectors in a charge lattice, as for BPS states.
