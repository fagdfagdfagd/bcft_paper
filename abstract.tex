We study the quantum quench problem for a class of bosonic conformal interface by computing the Loschmidt echo and the bipartite fidelity. These boson conformal interfaces can be viewed as the change of boundary conditions (quench) when connecting two one-dimensional critical systems. They are classified by $S(\theta)$ matrices associated with the current scattering processes on the interface. The resulting Loschmidt echo of the quench has long time algebraic decay $t^{-\alpha}$, whose exponent also appears in the finite size bipartitle fidelity as $L^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$. We perform analytic and numerical calculation of the exponent $\alpha$, and find that it has a quadratic dependence on the change of $\theta$ if the prior and post quench boundary conditions are in the same type of $S$, while remains $\frac{1}{4}$ otherwise. Possible physical realizations of these interfaces includes for instance connecting different quantum wires (Luttinger liquids), quench of the topological phase edge states \etc and the exponent can be detected in a X-ray edge singularity type experiment.
